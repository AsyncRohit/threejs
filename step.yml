1). Basic setup of scene,camera and geometry 

first create a scene
then create a camera // new THREE.perspectiveCamera()
give the camera a position // camera.position.z=5;
add the camera to scene by using // scene.add(camera)

//creating a geometry 
now create a geometry by using // new THREE.BoxGeometry()
then create a material by using // new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial("any color") 
then create a mesh by using // new THREE.Mesh(geometry,material)
mesh is a combination of geometry and material
then add the mesh to the scene by using // scene.add(mesh)

//creating a renderer

renderer is a class that is used to render the scene  //any canvas or div can be used as a renderer
now create a renderer by using // new THREE.WebGLRenderer({canvas:any canvas or div})
now set the size of the renderer by using // renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth,window.innerHeight)
now render the scene by using // renderer.render(scene,camera)

2). how to perform animation in three.js

create a clock by using // new THREE.Clock()
crate a function with any name you want to give to it  for now suppose animate is the name 
now use the requestAnimationFrame() method to call the function //window.requestAnimationFrame(function)
simply call the function in the requestAnimationFrame method
for animating the object we use the clock.getElapsedTime() method
now do any changes in the function to animate the object

now we have to animate the object by calling the function  animate
